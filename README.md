****Virtual Pet Shelter****

-----Object:
You are in charge of a virtual pet shelter, congratulations! 
You will add one pet at a time to your shelter, to fill up infinite empty kennels! 
You may add any organic pet you choose. Cat? Dog? Iguana? The decision is yours!

It is the year 2020, and robotic pets are now also facing a homelessness epidemic. 
Add robotic pets to your shelter!
They will need attention, nourishment, and love, just like any organic pet would.

All pets can be adopted from your shelter, which will be a bittersweet goodbye as they go to their forever home.
